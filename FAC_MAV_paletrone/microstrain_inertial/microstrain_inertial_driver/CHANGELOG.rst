1.1.3 (2021-04-21)
------------------
* Removed duplicate Filter LLH Pos entry in message format
  Preparing for release on Bloom

* Add tf2_geometry_msgs as a dependency
* Merge pull request `#48 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/48>`_ from civerachb-cpr/master
  Make frame IDs configurable
* Add args for all of the frame ids to allow them to be modified when launching.  Keep the old static values as the defaults.
* Added frame ids back in to not break existing configurations
* Added a flag to set ENU as the local reference frame
  Moved sensor2vehicle frame transformation setting code to occur if filter data is not enabled
  See changelog for more info
* Added user notifications in the case a command isn't supported by a device.
  Added support for the speedometer lever arm offset command
* Corrected description in launch file to point out the quaternion version of the sensor2vehicle frame transformation is not currently supported on the GQ7
* Added ROS_INFO/ROS_ERROR reporting for setting sensor2vehicle frame transformation... had a silent error for the quaternion version on the GQ7.
* Added the filter GPS timestamp packet to the configured messages.
* - Driver modified to support MSCL version 61.1.6
  - Fixed missing boolean set for RTK status message publishing
* Timestamp change:
  1. Launch file setting "use_device_timestamp" (bool) created to allow user to select between device generated timestamp and packet received time (generated using PC time upon packet reception.)
  - Some applications require the PC received time to sync with other packages
  - Some applications require the device generated timestamp for accurate time of when the data was generated
  Hopefully, this satisfies both needs.
